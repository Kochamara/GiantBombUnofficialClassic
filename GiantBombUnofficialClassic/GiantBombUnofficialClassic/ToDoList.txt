Known bugs:

-Get videos request is returning live videos

V1.X release:
-Skip to beginning button
-Keep app from minimizing itself when clicking around in other applications, like opening new tabs in Chrome. Sometimes this happens when you alt+tab.
-Spacebar should pause, clicking on video should pause
-Make a better style for buttons
-Make styles for hyperlinks, text boxes, combo boxes
-Set focus on play/pause when media controls appear (instead of timeline)
-Give Xbox users a better way to give feedback
-Mouse "back" button should do the same thing as the back button on Xbox
-More video information, such as duration, the deck, which staff member uploaded it, etc.

-Konami code
-Someone asked for a GFB easter egg
-Reevaluate if the categories page is necessary, or if there's a better way to handle that selection

-Downloading of video files. Some users are having loading issues even on low quality.
-Playlist support (or maybe a watch later feature)
-Support for the new Compact Overlay feature in the Creators Update, allowing OS-level picture-in-picture. This is how Beam works, for example. You can see the implementation I'm thinking of by using the Movies & TV app (it calls it mini-mode, I think).
-Podcasts with backgrond audio support. There's a podcasts app in the Store if I need an example.
-Continue watching section
-Keyboard media shortcut support
-Change volume level with mouse scroll wheel

Feature requests I'm not so sure about:
-Allow video to resume playing even if the app is minimized
-Different layouts for viewing videos (especially search results), like lists or small thumbnails
-Site links for each video
